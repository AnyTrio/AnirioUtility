# AnirioUtility

## About

The [Templates](/src/_Templates/) folder contains template codes for class modules, utility modules, and regular scripts.

The main utilities can be found in [Anirio Replicated](/src/AnirioReplicated/).

Some utilities require [Signal](https://sleitnick.github.io/RbxUtil/api/Signal/) and [Trove](https://sleitnick.github.io/RbxUtil/api/Trove/) developed by Sleitnick. They are found in the [Sleitnick's](/src/OtherReplicated/Sleitnick's/) folder.

The [Anirio Server Script](/src/AnirioServerScript/) folder contains some example game scripts that utilize these utilities.<br>
These can be accompanied by assets found in the [Other Server Storage](/src/OtherServerStorage/) and [Other Replicated](/src/OtherReplicated/) folders.
